Though I could not unfortunately get my program to produce a proper output, I would imaging that 
the value iteration would take much longer for the slippery=True experiment versus the slipper=False
as the stochastic and random nature of the movement would require more iterations. The slippery=True 
would present less challenges and would be a more straight forward convergence process as there is no
stochastic element, but with the slippery experiment, I would imagine there would be some element of luck
as the agent steps through the environment and has to learn how to navigate those states with that
added element.
