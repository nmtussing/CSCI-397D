PPO 

* Advantage is negative: A < 0 
    our actions yielded worse results
    - action probability in turn decreases 
    -once this condition is met 
        the max is activated and hits a ceiling 
* VPG

* Genralized Advantage Estimation 
    - we can average and cut at each N step
    - GAE -> weighted average of all  n-step return estimators
